Use the following shell variables to influence the build
(defaults values given in brackets):

DEBUG=1|(0)
    Set to 1 to build the apps with: debug infos, asserts and 0-level
    optimizations.

LVGL_USE_SDL=(1)|0
    To build the apps for PC, using SDL2 emulation of screen and input devices.

LVGL_MINIMAL_BUILD=(0)|1
    By default the build infrastructure compiles all the source files in the
    project and then links the app with all produced object files. This
    ensures taht all the code compiles but slows down the build and generates a
    bigger than necessary executable.
    Setting LVGL_MINIMAL_BUILD=1 selects only the necessary object files
    for linking, reducing considerably the size of the app.
    NOTE: Though not yet fully implemented (only 'lv_examples' is optimized) this
          value does have a tangible positive effect on build's speed and size.


Examples (default settings which can be omitted are given in []):
-----------------------------------------------------------------
To build a release version of the 'demo' app on PC with SDL2 emulation:
  $ make clean all

To build the 'demo' app on PC with all objects, with SDL2 emulation and
with full debug info:
  $ [LVGL_MINIMAL_BUILD=0] [LVGL_USE_SDL=1] DEBUG=1 make clean all

To build a 'lean' demo app for your architecture, i.e. NOT linking un-
needed objects, NOT including gcc debug infos and NOT using SDL2 emulation:
  $ LVGL_MINIMAL_BUILD=1  LVGL_USE_SDL=0  [DEBUG=0] make clean all
