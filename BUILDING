Use the following shell variables to influence the build:

DEBUG=1
    To build the apps with debug symbols, 0-optimization and asserts.

LVGL_USE_SDL=[1|y|Y]
    To build the apps for PC, using SDL2 emulation of screen and input devices.

LVGL_BUILD_TUTORIAL=0     [default if not given]
    To build the demo app in lv_examples/lv_apps/demo/.
    This is the default if this var is not set.

LVGL_BUILD_TUTORIAL=1
    To build the 10_keyboard tutorial app in lv_examples/lv_tutorial.
    You may also look at the lv_tutorial_keyboard.mk file and choose
    between simulated keypad or real keyboard inside of it.

LVGL_MINIMAL_BUILD=0      [default if not given]
    By default the build infrastructure links the app with all object files.
    This setting leaves this as-is.

LVGL_MINIMAL_BUILD=1
    By default the build infrastructure links the app with all object files.
    This setting selects only the necessary object files for linking,
    reducing considerably the size of the apps.
    NOTE: This is not yet fully implemented


Examples:
---------
To build the 'demo' app on PC with full debug info:
$  DEBUG=1 LVGL_USE_SDL=1 make
   -OR-
$  DEBUG=1 LVGL_USE_SDL=1 LVGL_BUILD_TUTORIAL=0 make

To build the '10_keyboard' tutorial app for your architecture, with no debug infos:
$ LVGL_BUILD_TUTORIAL=1 make
NOTE: This will usually require specifying other options, depending on your target architecture.
